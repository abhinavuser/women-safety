A Women Safety Software

Problem Statement:
 Womenâ€™s safety remains a critical concern, with
 many women feeling unsafe in public spaces,
 especially during late hours.
 Incidents such as harassment, assault, and stalking
 often occur without timely intervention. Existing
 solutions are often reactive, with limited real-time
 response capabilities
